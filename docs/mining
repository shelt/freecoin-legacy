MINING

every 3 seconds
    update time in block
    check for changed latest_blockhash
every 60 seconds
    update mempool with unadded txs
on block solution found
    add block to blockchain
    update latest_blockhash
    send <inv> to all peers with latest block
on changed latest_blockhash
    discard current workblock
    start new workblock built upon latest block


NETWORK
on block solution recieved in inv
    add block to blockchain
    update latest_blockhash
    discard confirmed txs from mempool


You can have client peers or server peers.
All must be able to:
- Send to a peer
- Send to all
- Recieve from a peer

The miner and the client/server sockets must all
run parallel.
The socket threads must be able to access and modify:
    The workblock tx_count
    the workblock itself


What is the difference between miner and nonminer peers, and how should the code behave differently?
